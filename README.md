# DataStructuresHomework
A repository created to hold Patrick Martinez (patrickmartinez77@gmail.com) and Blake Hillier's (blakehillier@mac.com) shared homework assignments for CS2308-261 Data Structures with Husain Gholoom. To be made public after final grades are posted for the Spring '18 semester. A small write-up is to be written with each assignment a pdf will be stored in the homework's folder.

## Homework 1

This introductory homework assignment was to test and refresh our skills on C++. It is basically running several operations on a two-dimensional array. We were not allowed to use vectors, pointers or classes so it is all on a single file. Two 3 by 3 arrays were created populated by random integers from 1-12. 

## Homework 2

This 2nd homework assignment tested our knowledge of try catch blocks and vectors. We created a class called myGrades to manage a gradebook. It contained two vectors: one for tests and one for programs, and had various functions to either edit the gradebook or view the gradebook. This was done in one .cpp file.
