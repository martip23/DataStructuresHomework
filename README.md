# DataStructuresHomework
A repository created to hold Patrick Martinez (patrickmartinez77@gmail.com) and Blake Hillier's (blakehillier@mac.com) shared homework assignments for CS2308-261 Data Structures with Husain Gholoom. To be made public after final grades are posted for the Spring '18 semester. A small write-up is to be written with each assignment, along with the PDF of the homework. **We may not do this if there are concerns with cheating for the later semesters**
